## 2. Greedy Algorithms
  
  -Activity Selection https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_selection_problem
  
  -Fractional Knapsack Problem 
  
  ```
In Fractional Knapsack, we can break items for maximizing the total value of knapsack. 
This problem in which we can break an item is also called the fractional knapsack problem.
